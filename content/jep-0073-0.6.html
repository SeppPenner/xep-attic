<h2>1.
       <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">The protocols developed by the Jabber community have matured considerably since 1999. The core protocols were originally created by a small group of developers who worked on early Jabber-related open-source software projects such as the <span class="ref">jabberd</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596280">1</a>] server, the Winjab, Gabber, and Jarl clients, the Net::Jabber and Jabberbeans libraries, and gateways to consumer IM services. In the summer of 2001, the <span class="ref">Jabber Software Foundation (JSF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596308">2</a>] was founded to institute a formal standards process within the growing Jabber community (codified in <span class="ref">Jabber Enhancement Proposals</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596325">3</a>]). In late 2002, the <span class="ref">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596358">4</a>] formed the <span class="ref">XMPP Working Group</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596386">5</a>], which formalized the core Jabber protocols under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). In early 2004, the IETF approved the main XMPP specifications as Proposed Standards within the Internet Standards Process defined by <span class="ref">RFC 2026</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596200">6</a>]. In the meantime, the JSF has continued to develop additional protocols on top of XMPP in order to address functionality areas (such as file transfer) that were too application-specific for consideration within the IETF.</p>
  <p class="" style="">Given the large number of Jabber/XMPP protocols, it is not always clear to developers exactly which protocols they need to implement in order to interoperate over Jabber/XMPP networks. This JEP attempts to assist developers by defining a protocol suite for basic instant messaging and presence.</p>
<h2>2.
       <a name="reqs">Requirements and Approach</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">Defining a protocol suite provides a high-level &quot;bucket&quot; into which we can place specific functionality areas for development and compliance testing (note that this entire JEP applies to software implementations, not necessarily to particular deployments thereof). A baseline is provided by the XMPP specifications produced by the IETF's XMPP WG, which define XML streams, JID processing, channel encryption, authentication, the three primary XML stanza types (&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;), namespace handling, presence subscriptions, roster management, and privacy lists (whitelisting/blacklisting). However, basic Jabber instant messaging and presence applications should support several additional protocols that were not included in the XMPP specifications for either of the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They were not required to meet the requirements of <span class="ref">RFC 2779</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2601904">7</a>] (e.g, service discovery)</li>
    <li>They were and remain in common use within the Jabber community but did not meet the more stringent requirements of the IETF (e.g., old-style, non-SASL authentication)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">The Basic IM Protocol Suite does not include more advanced IM functionality, such as groupchat or HTML message formatting; see <span class="ref">Intermediate IM Protocol Suite</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2601946">8</a>] for such features.</p>
<h2>3.
       <a name="def">Definition</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">The software developed in the Jabber community is built on the foundation of XML streams, a consistent addressing scheme (JIDs), channel encryption, authentication of an entity (client or server) with a server, three core data elements (&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;), and proper handling of XML namespaces. These foundational building blocks have been formalized within the <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602071">9</a>] specification produced by the XMPP WG, support for which is REQUIRED by this protocol suite (except as qualified for certain computing platforms in the <a href="#security">Security Considerations</a> section of this document). However, XMPP Core is not fully congruent with the core of what has traditionally been known as &quot;Jabber&quot;, and this divergence needs to be captured in the Basic IM Protocol Suite. In particular, the following are REQUIRED herein in order to ensure compatibility with the large deployed base of older Jabber software: 
     [<a href="#nt-id2601994">10</a>]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for <span class="ref">Non-SASL Authentication</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602038">11</a>] as a fallback method for authentication.</li>
    <li>Support for the error 'code' attribute specified in <span class="ref">Error Condition Mappings</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602023">12</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">The core specifications do not define everything that is normally expected of even a minimal instant messaging and presence application (in effect, they define the transport layer rather than the IM and presence application layer). Much of this IM and presence functionality is defined in <span class="ref">XMPP IM</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602110">13</a>] in order to meet the requirements of RFC 2779. In particular, XMPP IM defines roster management, presence subscriptions, privacy lists (whitelisting/blacklisting), and routing and delivery guidelines for clients and servers.</p>
  <p class="" style="">However, Jabber instant messaging and presence applications have traditionally also included the ability to discover information about other entities on the network, and to reply to queries for information. This behavior is extremely helpful because it ensures that entities on the network can determine each other's capabilities and thus understand how to communicate together. (The original such protocol was <span class="ref">Agent Information</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602153">14</a>], but that protocol has been superseded by <span class="ref">Service Discovery</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602263">15</a>].) Support for Service Discovery is therefore REQUIRED by this protocol suite, as well.</p>
  <p class="" style="">Traditionally, Jabber servers (and some services) have also offered the ability for clients to register accounts &quot;in-band&quot; (i.e., over Jabber/XMPP) in order to bootstrap participation on the network; this protocol is defined in <span class="ref">In-Band Registration</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602194">16</a>] and support for it is REQUIRED for servers but RECOMMENDED for clients (however, any given server deployment MAY disable in-band registration as a matter of service provisioning).</p>
  <p class="" style="">Thus we define the Basic IM Protocol Suite as follows:</p>

<h2>4.
       <a name="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">XMPP Core requires support for SASL and TLS as must-implement protocols. Unfortunately, support for these advanced security protocols is non-existent or unreliable at the time of writing on computing platforms for some common devices, most notably J2ME, Java, .NET, and Symbian. A client implementation of the Basic IM Protocol Suite is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support SASL and TLS; however, a client implementation MAY lack support for SASL and TLS if those protocols are difficult or impossible to implement on a particular computing platform given the existing state of technology. This proviso does not apply to server implementations, which MUST support SASL and TLS.</p>
<h2>5.
       <a name="iana">IANA Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">This JEP requires no interaction with the <span class="ref">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602574">17</a>].</p> 
<h2>6.
       <a name="registrar">Jabber Registrar Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">No namespaces or parameters need to be registered with the <span class="ref">Jabber Registrar</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602516">18</a>] as a result of this JEP.</p>

<a name="nt-id2601994">10</a>. Older software also used port 5223 for SSL-enabled communications between a client and a server, rather than upgrading port 5222 as is done during TLS negotiation (the equivalent for server-to-server communications was never implemented); while support for this behavior is OPTIONAL, it may be quite desirable in order to support older software as well as newer software that is unable to implement TLS as explained in the <a href="#security">Security Considerations</a> section of this document.</p>
