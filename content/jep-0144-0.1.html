<h2>1.
       <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">The Jabber protocols have long included a method for sending roster items from one entity to another, making use of the 'jabber:x:roster' namespace. Because this protocol extension was not required by <span class="ref">RFC 2779</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596083">1</a>], it was removed from <span class="ref">XMPP IM</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596115">2</a>] and documented for historical purposes in <span class="ref">Roster Item Exchange</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596135">3</a>]. However, since that time discussions in the <span class="ref">Standards JIG</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596154">4</a>] have revealed that it would be helpful to use roster item exchange in the problem spaces of &quot;shared groups&quot; (e.g., predefined roster groups used within an organization) and roster synchronization (e.g., keeping a Jabber roster in sync with a contact list on a legacy IM service). These problem spaces require a slightly more sophisticated kind of roster item exchange than was documented in JEP-0093, specifically the ability to indicate whether a roster item is to be added, deleted, or modified. Therefore this JEP redefines roster item exchange to provide this functionality in a way that is backwards-compatible with existing implementations, but uses a modern namespace URI of 'http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx' rather than the old 'jabber:x:roster' namespace name. Further JEPs will specify how to solve the problems of shared groups and roster synchronization using the protocol defined herein.</p>
<h2>2.
       <a name="reqs">Requirements</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">JEP-0093 did not define the requirements for roster item exchange. This section remedies that oversight.</p>
  <p class="" style="">Roster item exchange meets the following requirements:</p>
  <ol start="" type="">
    <li>Enable an entity to send one or more roster items to another entity, with the suggestion that the roster item(s) be added to the recipient's roster.</li>
    <li>Enable an entity to send one or more roster items to another entity, with the suggestion that the roster item(s) be deleted from the recipient's roster.</li>
    <li>Enable an entity to send one or more roster items to another entity, with the suggestion that the roster item(s) be modified in the recipient's roster.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="" style="">This JEP deliberately speaks of rosters and roster items, not presence subscriptions. Although rosters and subscriptions are closely connected (as explained in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span>), they are not identical. The protocol defined herein enables an entity to suggest that another entity might want to add, delete, or modify roster items only, and does not dictate the suggested presence subscription state associated with those roster items. This is intentional.</p>

       <a name="usecases">Use Cases</a>
</h2>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>3.1 <a name="add">Suggesting Roster Item Addition</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">In order to programatically suggest that the receiving entity should add one or more items to its roster, the sending entity MUST send a &lt;message/&gt; or &lt;iq/&gt; stanza containing an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx' namespace (see <a href="#stanza">Recommended Stanza Type</a> regarding when to use &lt;message/&gt; and when to use &lt;iq/&gt;); the &lt;x/&gt; element in turn MUST contain one or more &lt;item/&gt; child elements, each of which SHOULD possess an 'action' attribute whose value is &quot;add&quot;  [<a href="#nt-id2596312">5</a>], MUST possess a 'jid' attribute that specifies the JabberID of the item to be added, MAY possess a 'name' attribute that specifies a natural-language name or nickname for the item, and MAY contain one or more &lt;group/&gt; elements specifying roster groups into which to place the item. The &lt;message/&gt; stanza SHOULD NOT contain any other child elements. Here is an example:</p>
    <p class="caption">Example 1. Suggesting Addition</p>
<div class="indent"><pre>
&lt;message from='horatio@denmark.lit' to='hamlet@denmark.lit'&gt;
  &lt;x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx'&gt; 
    &lt;item action='add'
          jid='rosencrantz@denmark'
          name='Rosencrantz'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Visitors&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item action='add'
          jid='guildenstern@denmark'
          name='Guildenstern'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Visitors&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
    </pre></div>
    <p class="" style="">In determining how to handle any given roster item whose 'action' attribute has a value of &quot;add&quot; (either explicitly or as the default value), the receiving application SHOULD proceed as follows:</p>
    <ol start="" type="">
      <li>If the item already exists in the roster and the item is in the specified group (or no group is specified), the receiving application MUST NOT prompt a human user for approval regarding that item and MUST NOT add that item to the roster.</li>
      <li>If the item does not already exist in the roster, the receiving application SHOULD prompt a human user for approval regarding that item and, if approval is granted, MUST add that item to the roster.</li>
      <li>If the item already exists in the roster but not in the specified group, the receiving application MAY prompt the user for approval and SHOULD edit the existing item so that will also belong to the specified group (in addition to the existing group, if any).</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">If the roster item addition stanza will result in adding the item to the roster, the receiving application MUST (either with approval by a human user or automatically subject to configuration) send a roster set to the user's server containing the new item as described in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span>. After completing the roster set, the receiving application SHOULD also send a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza of type &quot;subscribe&quot; to the JID of the new item.</p>
    <p class="" style="">For a description of the recommended application behavior when a roster item addition stanza actually results in editing of an existing roster item, refer to the <a href="#modify">Suggesting Roster Item Modification</a> section of this document.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>3.2 <a name="delete">Suggesting Roster Item Deletion</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">In order to programatically suggest that the receiving entity should delete one or more items from its roster, the sending entity MUST send a &lt;message/&gt; stanza containing an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx' namespace; the &lt;x/&gt; element in turn MUST contain one or more &lt;item/&gt; child elements, each of which MUST possess an 'action' attribute whose value is &quot;delete&quot;, MUST possess a 'jid' attribute that specifies the JabberID of the item to be added, MAY possess a 'name' attribute that specifies a natural-language name or nickname for the item, and MAY contain one or more &lt;group/&gt; elements specifying roster groups into which to place the item. The &lt;message/&gt; stanza SHOULD NOT contain any other child elements. Here is an example:</p>
    <p class="caption">Example 2. Suggesting Deletion</p>
<div class="indent"><pre>
&lt;message from='horatio@denmark.lit' to='hamlet@denmark.lit'&gt;
  &lt;x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx'&gt; 
    &lt;item action='delete'
          jid='rosencrantz@denmark'
          name='Rosencrantz'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Visitors&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item action='delete'
          jid='guildenstern@denmark'
          name='Guildenstern'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Visitors&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
    </pre></div>
    <p class="" style="">In determining how to handle any given roster item whose 'action' attribute has a value of &quot;delete&quot;, the receiving application SHOULD proceed as follows:</p>
    <ol start="" type="">
      <li>If the item does not exist in the roster, the receiving application MUST NOT prompt a human user for approval regarding that item and MUST NOT delete that item to the roster.</li>
      <li>If the item exists in the roster but not in the specified group, the receiving application MUST NOT prompt the user for approval and MUST NOT delete the existing item.</li>
      <li>If the item exists in the roster and is in both the specified group and another group, the receiving application MAY prompt the user for approval and SHOULD edit the existing item so that it no longer belongs to the specified group.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">If a roster item deletion stanza will result in removal of the item from the roster (rather than editing of the item), the receiving application MUST (either with approval by a human user or automatically subject to configuration) send a roster set to the user's server with the 'subscription' attribute set to a value of &quot;remove&quot; as described in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span>, since this results in generation of the appropriate &lt;presence/&gt; stanzas by the user's server.</p>
    <p class="" style="">For a description of the recommended application behavior when a roster item deletion stanza actually results in editing of an existing roster item, refer to the <a href="#modify">Suggesting Roster Item Modification</a> section of this document.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>3.3 <a name="modify">Suggesting Roster Item Modification</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">In order to programatically suggest that the receiving entity should modify one or more items from its roster, the sending entity MUST send a &lt;message/&gt; stanza containing an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx' namespace; the &lt;x/&gt; element in turn MUST contain one or more &lt;item/&gt; child elements, each of which MUST possess an 'action' attribute whose value is &quot;modify&quot;, MUST possess a 'jid' attribute that specifies the JabberID of the item to be added, MAY possess a 'name' attribute that specifies a natural-language name or nickname for the item, and MAY contain one or more &lt;group/&gt; elements specifying roster groups into which to place the item. The &lt;message/&gt; stanza SHOULD NOT contain any other child elements. Here is an example:</p>
    <p class="caption">Example 3. Suggesting Modification</p>
<div class="indent"><pre>
&lt;message from='horatio@denmark.lit' to='hamlet@denmark.lit'&gt;
  &lt;x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx'&gt; 
    &lt;item action='modify'
          jid='rosencrantz@denmark'
          name='Rosencrantz'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Retinue&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item action='modify'
          jid='guildenstern@denmark'
          name='Guildenstern'&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;Retinue&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
    </pre></div>
    <p class="" style="">In determining how to handle any given roster item whose 'action' attribute has a value of &quot;modify&quot;, the receiving application SHOULD proceed as follows:</p>
    <ol start="" type="">
      <li>If the item does not exist in the roster, the receiving application MUST NOT prompt a human user for approval regarding that item and MUST NOT add that item to the roster.</li>
      <li>If the item exists in the roster and the modification results in a change of group only, the receiving application MAY prompt the user for approval and SHOULD move the item to the specified group.</li>
      <li>If the item exists in the roster and the modification results adding the item to a new group in addition to its existing group, the receiving application MAY prompt the user for approval and SHOULD add the item to the specified group.</li>
      <li>If the item exists in the roster and the modification results in a change of name only, the receiving application MAY prompt the user for approval and SHOULD modify the name to that specified in the modification suggestion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">If a roster item addition, deletion, or modification stanza will result in editing of an existing item in the roster, the receiving application MUST (either with approval by a human user or automatically subject to configuration) send a roster set to the user's server with no changes to the 'subscription' attribute but rather with appropriate changes to the value of 'name' attribute or the &lt;group/&gt; child element or elements, as described in <span style="font-weight: bold">XMPP IM</span>.</p>
  </div>
<h2>4.
       <a name="disco">Service Discovery</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">In order to determine whether a receiving entity supports the protocol defined herein, the sending entity SHOULD use <span class="ref">Service Discovery</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602128">6</a>] but MAY depend on the &quot;profile&quot; of Service Discovery defined in <span class="ref">Entity Capabilities</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602149">7</a>]. If an entity supports roster item exchange, it MUST (subject to appropriate security considerations as described under <a href="#security-support">Advertising Support</a>) include &lt;feature var='http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx'/&gt; in its responses to disco#info queries. Thus a sending entity can discover if a receiving entity supports the protocol defined herein by sending an IQ request of the following form:</p>
  <p class="caption">Example 4. Sending Entity Queries for Support</p>

&lt;iq from='horatio@denmark.lit/castle'

  </pre></div>
<h2>5.
       <a name="stanza">Recommended Stanza Type</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">If the sending entity has knowledge (e.g., via presence or an active chat conversation) that the receiving entity is online and available, it SHOULD:  [<a href="#nt-id2602093">8</a>]</p>
  <ol start="" type="">
    <li>Discover if the receiving entity supports the protocol defined herein (see the <a href="#disco">Service Discovery</a> section of this document).</li>
    <li>If so, send its roster item exchange stanza to a particular resource (user@host/resource) of the receiving entity using an &lt;iq/&gt; stanza rather than a &lt;message/&gt; stanza.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="" style="">If the sending entity does not know that the receiving entity is online and available, it MUST send a &lt;message/&gt; stanza to the receiving entity's &quot;bare JID&quot; (user@host) rather than an &lt;iq/&gt; stanza to a particular resource.</p>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>5.1 <a name="stanza-iq">IQ Semantics</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">If the sending entity uses &lt;iq/&gt; stanzas to communicate its roster item exchange suggestions, the receiving entity MUST adhere to the IQ semantics defined in <span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602306">9</a>]. Specifically:</p>
    <ol start="" type="">
      <li>If the receiving entity successfully processes the suggested action(s) (which may include ignoring certain suggestions), the receiving entity MUST return an empty IQ result to the sending entity.</li>
      <li>If the receiving entity does not understand the roster item exchange namespace, the receiving entity MUST return an error to the sending entity, which error SHOULD be &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.</li>
      <li>If the receiving entity will not process the suggested action(s) because the receiving entity is not registered with the sending entity, the receiving entity MUST return an error to the sending entity, which error SHOULD be &lt;registration-required/&gt;.</li>
      <li>If the receiving entity will not process the suggested action(s) because the sending entity is not in the receiving entity's roster, the receiving entity MUST return an error to the sending entity, which error SHOULD be &lt;not-authorized/&gt;.</li>
      <li>If the receiving entity will not process the suggested action(s) because the sending entity is not trusted (see <a href="#security-trust">Trusted Entities</a>), the receiving entity MUST return an error to the sending entity, which error SHOULD be &lt;forbidden/&gt;.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="" style="">Naturally, other IQ errors may be more appropriate; however, if the receiving entity will not or cannot process the suggested action(s), it MUST return an error to the sending entity.</p>
  </div>
<h2>6.
       <a name="bizrules">Business Rules</a>
</h2>
  <ol start="" type="">
    <li><p class="" style="">The sending entity or sending application SHOULD NOT send additions, deletions, and modifications in the same &lt;x/&gt; element and &lt;message/&gt; stanza; instead, it SHOULD send separate stanzas for the additions, deletions, and modifications.</p></li>
    <li><p class="" style="">If approval is required or recommended regarding more than one item suggested by the sending entity, the receiving entity SHOULD present all of the items for approval at the same time or in the same interface; however, the receiving application may want to split additions, deletions, and modifications into separate prompts so as not to confuse the user.</p></li>
    <li><p class="" style="">If the sending entity is in some sense &quot;trusted&quot; (see <a href="#security-trust">Trusted Entities</a>), then the receiving application MAY skip the approval steps described above.</p></li>
    <li><p class="" style="">The receiving application SHOULD NOT accept an unreasonable number of roster items from any one sending entity at one time. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to determine how many roster items are &quot;unreasonable&quot;. For example, when a user registers with a gateway, it is possible that the initial set of roster items may be quite large (however, note that most existing consumer IM services enforce a limit of 100 to 150 items in their contact lists). Users who have newly registered with or been newly created on a server (e.g., within an organization) may also receive a large set of initial roster items in order to sync up with shared groups established on the server. However, after such initialization, the subsequent roster item sets should be much smaller. In any case, sets of more than 150 or 200 roster items SHOULD be treated with suspicion, and entities that repeatedly send such sets SHOULD NOT be trusted.</p></li>

<h2>7.
       <a name="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>7.1 <a name="security-trust">Trusted Entities</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">A principal (user) or receiving application MAY establish a list of trusted entities from which roster item exchanges are handled without approval by a human user. In order to avoid corruption of the roster, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that such trusted entities meet at least one of the following criteria, in order of trustworthiness:</p> 
    <ol start="" type="">
      <li><p class="" style="">The sending entity is a component (e.g., &quot;groups.example.com&quot;) or authoritative representative (e.g., &quot;admin@example.com&quot; if that address is reserved) of the server with which the receiving entity is registered, or the sending entity is the server itself (e.g., &quot;example.com&quot;), such that the receiving application can trust the sending entity as much as it trusts the server.</p></li>
      <li><p class="" style="">The sending entity has a <span style="font-weight: bold">Service Discovery</span> identity that typically involves responsibility for roster items (e.g., &quot;gateway/msn&quot;) and the receiving entity has previously and explicitly registered with the sending entity, including acknowledgement on the user's part that the sending entity will suggest roster items that may be automatically approved by the receiving application (e.g., a human user has registered with a gateway); such trust SHOULD be periodically verified with the human user (e.g., once per session in which the sending entity suggests roster additions, modifications, or deletions).</p></li>
      <li><p class="" style="">The sending entity has otherwise been explicitly approved by a human user as the trusted source of roster items; such trust SHOULD extend to specified roster groups only (e.g., a sender of &quot;stpeter@jabber.org&quot; is trusted only for the &quot;JSF Members&quot; group), and SHOULD be periodically verified with the human user (e.g., once per session in which the sending entity suggests roster additions, modifications, or deletions).</p></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="indent">
<h3>7.2 <a name="security-dos">Denial of Service</a>
</h3>
    <p class="" style="">A sending entity could effectively deny service to the receiving entity by rapidly and repeatedly sending (1) alternating add and delete suggestions or (2) modify suggestions, thus invoking throttling mechanisms enforced by the receiving entity's server. The receiving application SHOULD guard against this by monitoring roster item exchanges received from each sending entity and refusing or ignoring roster item exchanges from offending entities (e.g., by adding such entities to a list of distrusted entities).</p>
