<h2>Relation to XMPP</h2>
<p class="indent">The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is defined in the XMPP Core (RFC 3920) and XMPP IM (RFC 3921) specifications contributed by the Jabber Software Foundation to the Internet Standards Process, which is managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force in accordance with RFC 2026.

<h2>1.
       <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">Given the large number of Jabber/XMPP protocols, 
     [<a href="#nt-id2596242">1</a>]
  it is not always clear to developers exactly which protocols they need to implement in order to interoperate over Jabber/XMPP networks. This JEP attempts to assist developers by defining a protocol suite for basic instant messaging and presence.</p>
<h2>2.
       <a name="reqs">Requirements and Approach</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">Defining a protocol suite provides a high-level &quot;bucket&quot; into which we can place specific functionality areas for development and compliance testing. A baseline is provided by RFCs 3920 and 3921, which define XML streams, JID processing, channel encryption, authentication, the three primary XML stanza types (&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;), namespace handling, presence subscriptions, roster management, and privacy lists (whitelisting/blacklisting). However, basic Jabber instant messaging and presence applications should support several additional protocols that were not included in the XMPP specifications for either of the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They were not required to meet the requirements of <span class="ref">RFC 2779</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602054">10</a>] (e.g, service discovery)</li>
    <li>They were and remain in common use within the Jabber community but did not meet the more stringent requirements of the IETF (e.g., old-style, non-SASL authentication)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">The Basic IM Protocol Suite does not include more advanced IM functionality, such as groupchat or HTML message formatting; see <span class="ref">Intermediate IM Protocol Suite</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602173">11</a>] for such features.</p>
<h2>3.
       <a name="def">Definition</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">The software developed in the Jabber community is built on the foundation of XML streams, a consistent addressing scheme (JIDs), channel encryption, authentication of an entity (client or server) with a server, three core data elements (&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;), and proper handling of XML namespaces. These foundational building blocks have been formalized within RFC 3920, support for which is REQUIRED by this protocol suite. However, XMPP Core is not fully congruent with the core of what has traditionally been known as &quot;Jabber&quot;, and this divergence needs to be captured in the Basic IM Protocol Suite. In particular, the following are REQUIRED herein in order to ensure compatibility with the large deployed base of older Jabber software: 
     [<a href="#nt-id2602097">12</a>]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for <span class="ref">Non-SASL Authentication</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602147">13</a>] as a fallback method for authentication.</li>
    <li>Support for the error 'code' attribute specified in <span class="ref">Error Condition Mappings</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602272">14</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="" style="">RFC 3920 does not define everything that is normally expected of even a minimal instant messaging and presence application (in effect, it defines the transport layer rather than the IM and presence application layer). Much of this IM and presence functionality is defined in RFC 3921 in order to meet the requirements of RFC 2779. In particular, RFC 3921 defines roster management, presence subscriptions, privacy lists (whitelisting/blacklisting), and routing and delivery guidelines for clients and servers.</p>
  <p class="" style="">However, Jabber instant messaging and presence applications have traditionally also included the ability to discover information about other entities on the network, and to reply to queries for information. This behavior is extremely helpful because it ensures that entities on the network can determine each other's capabilities and thus understand how to communicate together. (The original such protocol was <span class="ref">Agent Information</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602234">15</a>], but that protocol has been superseded by <span class="ref">Service Discovery</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602249">16</a>].) Support for Service Discovery is therefore REQUIRED by this protocol suite, as well.</p>
  <p class="" style="">Traditionally, Jabber servers (and some services) have also offered the ability for clients to register accounts &quot;in-band&quot; (i.e., over Jabber/XMPP) in order to bootstrap participation on the network; this protocol is defined in <span class="ref">In-Band Registration</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2602308">17</a>] and support for it is REQUIRED for servers but RECOMMENDED for clients (however, any given server deployment MAY disable in-band registration as a matter of service provisioning).</p>
  <p class="" style="">Thus we define the Basic IM Protocol Suite as follows:</p>

<h2>4.
       <a name="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h2>
  <p class="" style="">RFC 3920 requires support for SASL and TLS as must-implement protocols, and that support is not modified herein. Refer to <span style="font-weight: bold">JEP-0078: Non-SASL Authentication</span> for an explanation of the older authentication method still in use by various existing client and server implementations and deployments, as well as the proper order of precedence between SASL authentication (RFC 3920) and non-SASL authentication (JEP-0078).</p>

<a name="notes"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
<a name="nt-id2596242">1</a>. The protocols developed by the Jabber community have matured considerably since 1999. The core protocols were originally created by a small group of developers who worked on early Jabber-related open-source software projects such as the <span class="ref">jabberd</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596351">2</a>] server, the Winjab, Gabber, and Jarl clients, the Net::Jabber and Jabberbeans libraries, and gateways to consumer IM services. In the summer of 2001, the <span class="ref">Jabber Software Foundation (JSF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596380">3</a>] was founded to institute a formal standards process within the growing Jabber community (codified in <span class="ref">Jabber Enhancement Proposals</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596408">4</a>]). In late 2002, the <span class="ref">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2601946">5</a>] formed the <span class="ref">XMPP Working Group</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2601973">6</a>], which formalized the core Jabber protocols under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). In early 2004, the IETF approved the main XMPP specifications as Proposed Standards within the Internet Standards Process defined by <span class="ref">RFC 2026</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596277">7</a>], resulting in publication of <span style="font-weight: bold">RFC 3920</span> (<span class="ref">XMPP Core</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596301">8</a>]) and <span style="font-weight: bold">RFC 3921</span> (<span class="ref">XMPP IM</span>  [<a href="#nt-id2596327">9</a>]). In the meantime, the JSF has continued to develop additional protocols on top of XMPP in order to address functionality areas (such as file transfer) that were too application-specific for consideration within the IETF.</p>
<p>
<a name="nt-id2596351">2</a>. The jabberd server is the original server implementation of the Jabber protocols, first developed by Jeremie Miller, inventor of Jabber. For further information, see &lt;<a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/">http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>
<a name="nt-id2596380">3</a>. The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) is an independent, non-profit organization that develops open application protocols on top of the IETF's Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

<p>
<a name="nt-id2601973">6</a>. The XMPP Working Group was created by the Internet Engineering Task Force to define an adaptation of the base Jabber protocols that could be considered an IETF-approved instant messaging and presence technology.

<p>
<a name="nt-id2602097">12</a>. Older software also used port 5223 for SSL-enabled communications between a client and a server, rather than upgrading port 5222 as is done during TLS negotiation (the equivalent for server-to-server communications was never implemented); while support for this behavior is OPTIONAL, it may be quite desirable in order to interoperate with older software and deployments.</p>
